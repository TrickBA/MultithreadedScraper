Multithreaded Web Crawler
====

Hi all!

I wanted to spice/speed up the task of crawling by doing it in a multithreaded way.

This short README will cover the following aspects:

1.  How to use
2.  Implementation details

1. How to use
----

Assuming Java (tested with JRE 1.6) you can start crawling using the following command:
```
// The first argument to the JAR is the URL
// The second argument is the maximum number of threads that should be created
java -jar /path/to/Scraper.jar http://www.google.com 40
```

2.  Implementation details
----

Let's take a quick look at the project structure:
```
Scraper
| src
   |  Threading: Encapsulates Thread and Inter-Thread communication logic
   |  Util:  Contains Helper classes
   |  ScrapeClient: API Access point
   |  Scraper: Interface to the Command Line
   |  ScrapeTask: Thread subclass that carries out the scraping (using jsoup)
   |  URL Repository: Holds the data
```

The actual scraping is performed on top of [jsoup](http://jsoup.org).

Walking through the source should provide you with a clear picture. I recommend you to start by looking at the `Scraper.java` class as this acts as the interface to the command line.
